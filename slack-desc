leptonlib: leptonlib (An OS lib for efficient image processing and analysis)
leptonlib:
leptonlib: Well-tested C library for some basic image processing operations,
leptonlib: along with a description of the functions and some design methods.
leptonlib: A full set of affine transformations (translation, shear, rotation,
leptonlib: scaling) on images of all depths is included, with the exception
leptonlib: that some of the scaling methods do not work at all depths.  There
leptonlib: are also implementations of binary morphology, grayscale
leptonlib: morphology, convolution and rank order filters, and applications
leptonlib: such as jbig2 image processing and color quantization.
leptonlib: You will also find basic utilities for the safe and efficient
leptonlib: handling of arrays (of strings, numbers, number pairs and image-
leptonlib: related geometrical objects), byte queues, generic stacks, generic
leptonlib: lists, and endian-independent indexing into 32-bit arrays.

leptonica: leptonica (An OS lib for efficient image processing and analysis)
leptonica:
leptonica: Well-tested C library for some basic image processing operations,
leptonica: along with a description of the functions and some design methods.
leptonica: A full set of affine transformations (translation, shear, rotation,
leptonica: scaling) on images of all depths is included, with the exception
leptonica: that some of the scaling methods do not work at all depths.  There
leptonica: are also implementations of binary morphology, grayscale
leptonica: morphology, convolution and rank order filters, and applications
leptonica: such as jbig2 image processing and color quantization.
leptonica: You will also find basic utilities for the safe and efficient
leptonica: handling of arrays (of strings, numbers, number pairs and image-
leptonica: related geometrical objects), byte queues, generic stacks, generic
leptonica: lists, and endian-independent indexing into 32-bit arrays.
